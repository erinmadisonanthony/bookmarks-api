# bookmarks-api
This app was built in conjunction with a tutorial by Cryce Truly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFzRy8KVcrM&t=256s. The idea and original code are attributed to him. Building the app from scratch alongside the tutorial allowed me to learn how each component works, and deepened my understanding of APIs.
